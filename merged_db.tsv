It works by reducing the amount of cholesterol that your body absorbs from your diet. Aspartame is a low-calorie sweetener used to make the medication more palatable. 

Regarding its effect on ALKPHOS (Alkaline Phosphatase), colestyramine does not directly affect ALKPHOS levels. However, it can indirectly affect ALKPHOS levels in patients with certain liver or bone diseases, as it can interfere with the absorption of certain other medications or fat-soluble vitamins. Any changes in ALKPHOS levels would likely be due to the underlying condition rather than the medication itself. Always consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice."
